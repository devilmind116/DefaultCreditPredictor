# DefaultCreditPredictor
A Machine Learning Model that predicts Default Credit Card Payments based on Amount billed that month and last six month payment and billing history

Introduction
About the dataset:
This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

Features:
There are 25 features:

ID: ID of each client
LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual and family/supplementary credit
SEX: Gender (1=male, 2=female)
EDUCATION: (1=graduate school, 2=university, 3=high school, 4=others, 5=unknown, 6=unknown)
MARRIAGE: Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=others)
AGE: Age in years
PAY_0: Repayment status in September, 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for one month, 2=payment delay for two months, ... 8=payment delay for eight months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above)
PAY_2: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above)
PAY_3: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above)
PAY_4: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above)
PAY_5: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above)
PAY_6: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)
BILL_AMT1: Amount of bill statement in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
BILL_AMT2: Amount of bill statement in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
BILL_AMT3: Amount of bill statement in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
BILL_AMT4: Amount of bill statement in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
BILL_AMT5: Amount of bill statement in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
PAY_AMT1: Amount of previous payment in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
PAY_AMT2: Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
PAY_AMT3: Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
PAY_AMT4: Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
PAY_AMT5: Amount of previous payment in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
default.payment.next.month: Default payment (1=yes, 0=no)
Overview:
This is one of my early data science projects. I've used my skills like data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization and machine learning. I hope to carry out a research and to build several ML models to predict defaulters of credit card payments and compare their performance.

This notebook consisits of the following parts:

1) Exploratory Data Analysis

2) Data cleaning and further exploration

3) Building a base model

4) Feature Engineering

5) Building ML model using various algorithms and comparing them

This is the step by step approach followed for Efficient Model Creation
